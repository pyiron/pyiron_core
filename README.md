# Overview

# Transient technical details

This project amalgamates multiple sources, including modified versions of [`pyironflow`](https://github.com/pyiron/pyironFlow/) and [`pyiron_nodes`](https://github.com/pyiron/pyiron_nodes).
Python requirements across all components are collected in `project.env`.
With a suitable python environment in place, generate a development build of the Javascript components with `npm install; npm run dev`.
